SDLC and Its' Phases
==============================
SDLC : Software development life cycle 
There are following phases of life cycle 

i. Requirement Gathering 		: by BA (Business Analysyst)
		- Understanding of Current work or business needs
		- Understanding of proposed system 
		- Feasibility study 
		- Estimation :
			Tools and Technology
			Resources(Hardware, software, human)
			Timeline
			Cost

		- Documentations
			- SRS: System requirement specification 
				Architecture
				Timeline
				Objective				
			- BR : Business requirement
				Functionalities  
			- FR : Funcational requirement
				Usecase : where and how to use application 
	
ii. Design				: by Software Architect(Solution Architect/Principal Engineer)
		- HLD (high level design) : Breakdown the applicaiton in modules 
					Example: HDFC Banking
						Modules: ATM Banking, Branch Banking, Mobile .....

				
		- LLD (low level design) : dependency between these modules, and every module functionalities 


				
			
iii. Development			: by Developer 
		- Write the source code to given requirement and develop the executable(runnable) product

iv. Testing				: by QA(Quality Analyst), SQT (Software Quality Tesing), Test Engineer 
	
v. Release				: by DevOps Person (Server Owner or Administrator)


Post Phase :

vi. Maintainance 			: all above steps or phases will be repeated whenever new requiment will come

	
SRS & FRS(FR) & BRS(BR)
============================================================
SRS 
FRS(FR)  
BRS(BR)

Level of Testing 
======================================
- Unit Testing				: by Developer
- IT (integration Testing)		: by QA		
- ST (system testing)			: QA
- UAT (User Acceptence Testing)		: User, BA(Business Analyst)


Agile Methodlogy 
==================================
Agile: is metholdy which is combination of incremental and iterative model 
     : Agile is framework (set of rules and regulation)
	- Scrum
		Backlog:	is container of tasks/todos 
		UserStory: 	every task is called userstory 
		Sprint: 	 is timebox(2 weeks to 6 weeks) , in which we have to complete the task 
		Ceremoney:	meetings 
				- Backlog grooming
				- Sprint planning
				- Daily Standup or scrum call 
				- Sprint Review/Restropective 
		Velocity
		Story Point 		
	- Kanban
	- Bug Tracking
